# Week 2: Strategic Planning vs. Strategic Thinking  

Strategic planning and strategic thinking are related but distinct concepts. Planning emphasizes structure, discipline, and systematic execution, while thinking emphasizes creativity, adaptability, and vision. Organizations that rely solely on planning risk becoming rigid, whereas those that embrace thinking often find new opportunities.  

A clear example is seen in the Nigerian telecommunications industry. **MTN Nigeria** relied heavily on structured strategic planning. Its disciplined rollout of nationwide infrastructure, detailed investment roadmaps, and resource allocation strategies enabled it to dominate the market with reliability and scale. However, its rigid adherence to structured planning initially made it slower to adapt to customer-friendly innovations like *per-second billing*.  

By contrast, **Globacom (Glo)** demonstrated the power of strategic thinking. Rather than waiting for regulatory approval or competitor alignment, Glo boldly introduced *per-second billing*, a disruptive move that directly addressed consumer pain points. This act of creative foresight forced the entire industry to adapt, earning Glo recognition as an innovative challenger despite having fewer resources than MTN.  

Globally, companies like **Kodak** illustrate the danger of excessive reliance on planning. Kodakâ€™s detailed strategies for protecting its film business blinded it to the future of digital photography. Meanwhile, **Netflix** thrived through strategic thinking by reinventing itself from DVD rentals to a global streaming leader.  

In conclusion, strategic planning is necessary for order, but without strategic thinking, organizations risk irrelevance. The most successful companies balance the two, combining discipline with imagination.
